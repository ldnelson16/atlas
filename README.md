The **UMICH Atlas Web Scraper and Academic Advisor** project offers an innovative approach to academic planning and decision-making. It leverages web scraping techniques, powered by the Selenium library, to gather essential information from the University of Michigan's ATLAS platform. This data includes class offerings, course details, student reviews, and other academic resources.

The collected data is then processed and analyzed to address various academic-related questions and concerns. Whether you're a student looking to optimize your academic journey, explore double major opportunities, or simply make informed decisions about your coursework, this project provides valuable insights.
