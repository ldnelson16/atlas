### Webscraper README

## How to Use:
Step 1, Download chrome webdriver off online
Step 2, Place it in the desired directory (mine lies directly in the home wsl directory)
Step 3, Install Python and related dependencies from "webscraper/requirements.txt"
Step 4, Execute Python file from atlas directory, NOT from webscraper directory

p.s. there are many times based on output information where it will feel like it is stalled, it is not, let it finish
